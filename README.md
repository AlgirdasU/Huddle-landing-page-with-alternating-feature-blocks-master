## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS

### What I learned

I chose this challenge so that I could practice by working with CSS Grid. The good thing is that I was able to write a responsive design using CSS grid.
The most difficult part of this challenge was actually to write HTML so that I could write CSS Grid in the easiest way possible. Not only that, some SVGs change their size depending on view, I solved this problem by using CSS properties "max-height" and "max-width", after that SVGs always had the same size.
I added some hover effects on CTA buttons, now it's look like 3D when I push it.
